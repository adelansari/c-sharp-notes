# 08_review: Advanced C# Programming Concepts

## Overview

The `08_review` folder is designed to explore advanced C# programming concepts. This section is ideal for deepening your understanding of complex C# features and programming techniques that are essential for high-level software development.

## Topics Covered

1. **Advanced Data Structures**
   - Exploring the use of advanced data structures like dictionaries, queues, stacks, and hash sets.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     Dictionary<int, string> users = new Dictionary<int, string>();
     users.Add(1, "Alice");
     users.Add(2, "Bob");
     // Accessing elements
     string userName = users[1];
     ```

2. **Delegates and Events**
   - Understanding the use of delegates for creating customizable method references and events for handling notifications.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     delegate void Notify();  // Delegate
     class ProcessBusinessLogic {
         public event Notify ProcessCompleted; // Event
         public void StartProcess() {
             // Process logic here
             OnProcessCompleted();
         }
         protected virtual void OnProcessCompleted() {
             ProcessCompleted?.Invoke();
         }
     }
     ```

3. **LINQ (Language Integrated Query)**
   - Learning how to use LINQ for more efficient data querying and manipulation.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
     var evenNumbers = numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0);
     foreach (var n in evenNumbers) {
         Console.WriteLine(n);
     }
     ```

4. **Asynchronous Programming**
   - Exploring asynchronous programming patterns in C# to improve application performance and responsiveness.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     async Task LongRunningOperation() {
         await Task.Delay(1000);  // Simulate a long-running task
         Console.WriteLine("Operation Completed");
     }
     ```

5. **Reflection and Attributes**
   - Understanding how to use reflection for inspecting and interacting with object types, and attributes for adding metadata to code.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     [Serializable]
     class MyClass {
         public int MyProperty { get; set; }
     }
     // Using reflection
     var myClassType = typeof(MyClass);
     var isSerializable = myClassType.IsDefined(typeof(SerializableAttribute), false);
     ```

## Study Notes

- Advanced data structures are crucial for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- Delegates and events are key to creating flexible and loosely-coupled applications.
- LINQ provides a powerful and concise way to query and manipulate data.
- Asynchronous programming is essential for developing responsive applications.
- Reflection and attributes offer advanced capabilities for type inspection and metadata processing.

## Exercises

1. Implement a complex data structure and perform various operations like adding, removing, and searching elements.
2. Create a simple event system using delegates and events, and simulate event handling.
3. Write a LINQ query to filter and process a collection of objects.
4. Create an asynchronous method and demonstrate how it improves application responsiveness.
5. Use reflection to inspect the properties and methods of a class, and use attributes to add custom metadata to a class or method.
